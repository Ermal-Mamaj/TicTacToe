#Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Python)


Overview
This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python, playable by two players. 
The game is played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking the board with either 'X' or 'O'. 
The first player to align three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If the board is filled without a winner, the game results in a draw. 
The game can be replayed multiple times without restarting the program.

Features
Two-player mode: Players alternate turns, taking control of either 'X' or 'O'.
Input validation: The game checks for valid moves and prevents players from selecting occupied spaces or entering invalid inputs.
Victory detection: The game checks for three-in-a-row horizontally, vertically, and diagonally to determine the winner.
Draw detection: If all spaces on the board are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
Replay option: After each game, players are given the option to replay or exit.
Technologies Used
Python: The entire game logic, user input, and game flow are implemented using Python.
